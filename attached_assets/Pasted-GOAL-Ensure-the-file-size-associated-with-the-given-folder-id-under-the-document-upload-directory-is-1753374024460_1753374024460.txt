GOAL
Ensure the file size associated with the given folder_id under the document_upload directory is correctly computed and displayed in the application.

CURRENT PROBLEM
What’s not working: File size is not getting populated for the folder_id.
Expected behavior: Application should show the accurate size of files (or cumulative folder size) linked to the folder_id.
USER EXPERIENCE
Who uses it: Users or admins managing document uploads.
When: When accessing documents under document_upload or viewing folder details.
They should be able to: See the correct file size and proceed confidently.
TECHNICAL CONTEXT
Priority level: High (since you’ve spent significant time troubleshooting).
Platform: Please confirm if this is desktop, mobile, or both.
Performance: File size calculation should be efficient.
To move forward, I need to clarify:
What kind of object is folder_id?

Is it a folder containing many files or a single document?
How do you currently calculate or retrieve the file size?

Directly reading from the filesystem?
Fetching size stored in a database?
Returned from an API?
Are you encountering any error messages or warnings in logs or console?

What technology stack is your app built on?

Is there any caching mechanism involved that might prevent updated file sizes from showing?

Common pitfalls to verify immediately:
Folder path correctness: Double-check if folder_id combines correctly with the document_upload base path.
Filesystem permissions: Ensure read permissions are granted for that directory.
File size property existence: Confirm file size attribute exists and is updated (in database or metadata).
Async or timing issue: If fetching file size asynchronously, confirm UI waits for data.
Database update flow: Verify that after upload or changes, file size is re-calculated and saved.
Next steps for you:
Share how your code currently obtains or assigns the file size for folder_id.
Provide any relevant error logs or diagnostic messages.
Specify your application’s language/framework for context.
Once I have these details, I can help you troubleshoot more precisely and suggest targeted fixes. Looking forward to your response!
