# LRU Cache Performance Impact Analysis

## Current System Performance (KV-Only)

### Current Response Times
- Database queries: 90-350ms
- KV cache hits: ~2-5ms overhead
- Total response time: 99-394ms

### Current Architecture
```
Request → KV Store Check → Database Query (if miss) → Response
```

## Adding LRU Cache - Performance Impact

### Expected Performance Gains

#### 1. Memory Access Speed
- **LRU Cache hits: <1ms** (in-memory access)
- **KV Cache hits: 2-5ms** (network/disk I/O)
- **Database queries: 90-350ms** (network + processing)

#### 2. Cache Hit Scenarios
```
Tier 1 (LRU - Memory): <1ms response
Tier 2 (KV Store): 2-5ms response  
Tier 3 (Database): 90-350ms response
```

#### 3. Performance Improvements
- **Frequently accessed data**: 95-99% faster (1ms vs 100-350ms)
- **Dashboard validation**: ~200ms → ~1ms for cached data
- **User sessions**: Near-instant response for repeat requests
- **Concurrent users**: Better handling with memory-resident hot data

### Memory Usage Impact

#### Estimated Memory Consumption
- **Founder cache**: ~1KB per entry × 1000 entries = 1MB
- **Dashboard cache**: ~5KB per entry × 500 entries = 2.5MB
- **Venture cache**: ~2KB per entry × 2000 entries = 4MB
- **Total estimated**: ~7.5MB additional memory usage

#### LRU Eviction Benefits
- Automatic cleanup of least-used entries
- Prevents memory bloat
- Maintains optimal working set in memory

### Performance Scenarios

#### High-Traffic Dashboard Access
- **Without LRU**: Every request hits KV (2-5ms) or DB (200ms+)
- **With LRU**: Popular dashboard data served in <1ms

#### Concurrent User Sessions
- **Current**: Each user request processes through KV/DB pipeline
- **With LRU**: Hot user data served instantly from memory

#### Real-Time Updates
- **Current**: Cache invalidation affects KV store only
- **With LRU**: Immediate memory updates + KV persistence

### Recommended Implementation

```typescript
// Hybrid caching strategy
Memory Cache (LRU) → KV Store → Database
     <1ms           2-5ms      90-350ms
```

#### Configuration
- **LRU TTL**: 5-15 minutes
- **KV TTL**: 10-20 minutes (backup persistence)
- **Max Memory**: 10MB limit with automatic eviction

### Expected Results
- **Dashboard load time**: 200ms → 1-5ms for cached data
- **User experience**: Near-instant dashboard refreshes
- **Server load**: Reduced database queries by 80-90%
- **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent users

### Trade-offs
- **Memory usage**: +7-10MB RAM consumption
- **Complexity**: Dual-cache invalidation logic
- **Dependencies**: Additional npm package (lru-cache)

## Recommendation
Adding LRU cache would provide **significant performance gains** (50-200x faster for cached data) with minimal memory overhead. The hybrid approach maintains data persistence while delivering sub-millisecond response times for frequently accessed dashboard data.
