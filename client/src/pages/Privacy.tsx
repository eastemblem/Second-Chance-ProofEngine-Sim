                  <p>
                    We collect and process Personal Data to operate and improve the Second Chance platform,
                    provide services to our users, fulfill our legal and contractual obligations, and pursue
                    legitimate business interests. Our use of your data is guided by principles of necessity,
                    transparency, and proportionality.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    One of the primary reasons we process Personal Data is to deliver the core functionality
                    of the Second Chance platform. This includes onboarding you as a founder, investor, or
                    partner; managing user accounts and permissions; and enabling the matching, evaluation,
                    and feedback mechanisms that power the platform.
                  </p>

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-1">
                      For founders, this means processing information such as your pitch deck, business details, 
                      and ProofScore inputs to generate automated validation assessments.
                    </p>

                  <p>
                    Finally, the Second Chance platform uses automated processing, including artificial
                    intelligence, to generate insights and scores based on startup data. These outputs such as
                    ProofScores, validation layers, and investor matching recommendations are generated
                    through algorithms that analyze structured founder inputs and historical scoring models.
                    However, such evaluations are advisory in nature and are not intended to constitute final
                    investment decisions.
