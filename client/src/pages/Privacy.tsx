                    We collect and process Personal Data to operate and improve
                    the Second Chance platform, provide services to our users,
                    fulfill our legal and contractual obligations, and pursue
                    legitimate business interests. Our use of your data is
                    guided by principles of necessity, transparency, and
                    proportionality. All processing activities are based on a
                    clear legal basis and are aligned with the expectations of
                    users, partners, and regulators.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    One of the primary reasons we process Personal Data is to
                    deliver the core functionality of the Second Chance
                    platform. This includes onboarding you as a founder,
                    investor, or partner; managing user accounts and
                    permissions; and enabling the matching, evaluation, and
                    feedback mechanisms that power the platform. For founders,
                    this means processing information such as your pitch deck,
                    business details, and ProofScore inputs to generate
                    automated validation assessments. For investors, this
                    involves handling mandate preferences, stage and sector
                    interests, and custom feedback fields to allow targeted
                    introductions and curated startup updates. Without
                    processing this information, we would be unable to provide
                    the services you expect from Second Chance.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We also use Personal Data to analyze platform performance,
                    understand usage patterns, and improve our technology. This
                    includes collecting and reviewing behavioral and technical
                    data such as page navigation, login frequency, and
                    engagement with evaluation dashboards in order to identify
                    bottlenecks, test new features, and measure the
                    effectiveness of our AI-assisted tools. These insights allow
                    us to make data-informed decisions to enhance the user
                    experience, improve matching accuracy, and refine our
                    validation scoring methodologies. While this data is often
                    anonymized or aggregated for product research purposes, some
                    processing involves identifiable information to support
                    personalized features or troubleshooting.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In addition to operational use, we process contact details
                    and engagement history to maintain communication with our
                    users. We may send you emails or notifications about
                    platform updates, upcoming pitch events, product
                    improvements, or cohort announcements. These communications
                    are designed to keep you informed and connected to relevant
                    opportunities. We will always offer you the ability to opt
                    out of non-essential marketing communications. However,
                    messages directly related to your use of the platform such
                    as onboarding reminders, matched introductions, or mandatory
                    updates will continue as necessary for the provision of our
                    services.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For investors and strategic partners, we may use profile and
                    preference data to facilitate curated introductions to
                    selected founders. This includes notifying you of new
                    founder cohorts, sharing summary validation outputs, and
                    enabling warm intros where a mutual interest is identified.
                    Such activities are designed to ensure relevance and
                    efficiency in the investor-founder matching process, and are
                    carried out in accordance with our legitimate interests and
                    those of our users.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We also process Personal Data for compliance and legal
                    purposes. This may include responding to lawful requests
                    from regulatory authorities, maintaining audit trails,
                    retaining access logs, and meeting any know-your-client
                    (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) obligations relevant to
                    our operations or those of our institutional partners. These
                    actions are taken in accordance with applicable UAE
                    regulations, including the PDPL, and international best
                    practices.

                  <p>
                    To safeguard the platform and our community, we monitor
                    technical and usage data for signs of unauthorized access,
                    fraudulent activity, or violations of our terms of service.
                    Our systems are designed to detect anomalous behavior such
                    as bot traffic, scraping, or brute- force login attempts. We
                    process this data to protect user accounts, maintain the
                    integrity of our systems, and ensure that our services are
                    used in accordance with their intended purpose.

                    The Second Chance platform uses automated systems, including
                    artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models, to
                    support the analysis, scoring, and validation of founder
                    submissions. These systems are integral to our ability to
                    process high volumes of startup information efficiently,
                    generate structured insights for investors, and provide
                    founders with objective, consistent feedback on their
                    readiness, strengths, and gaps.

                    When you submit materials to the platform such as your pitch
                    deck, founder profile, traction data, or milestone roadmap
                    our systems may apply algorithmic models to assess your
                    startup‚Äôs stage, progress, and alignment with investor
                    mandates. These models help generate outputs such as
                    ProofScores, validation layers, and investor matching
                    scores, all of which are designed to assist with
