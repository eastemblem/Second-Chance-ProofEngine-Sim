## User Preferences & Communication

### Communication Style
- **Primary Style**: Simple, everyday language
- **Technical Level**: Non-technical user - avoid code details and technical jargon
- **Response Format**: Calm, supportive tone with measured, professional language
- **Documentation**: Focus on outcomes and impacts rather than implementation details

### Development Communication Pattern
- Apply question-first approach to all technical development tasks
- Before implementing any feature or fix, ask relevant counter-questions to gather context
- Only proceed after asking "Do you want me to ask more questions, or should I proceed with the answer?"
- This approach reduces unnecessary work and produces better outputs by understanding requirements fully
- Continue this pattern throughout entire conversation

### Agent Memory Optimization (Updated: 2025-08-01)
- **Context Management**: Use targeted file searches and focused information sharing
- **Session Continuity**: Document decisions and progress in this file for future sessions
- **Concurrent Operations**: Execute multiple tools simultaneously to reduce back-and-forth
- **Documentation Priority**: Update this file with architectural changes and user preferences immediately

### Cache Management Requirements
- Always clear build cache when UI files change to ensure changes are immediately visible
- Use `rm -rf dist .vite && npm run build` or run `./clear-cache.sh` script
- Restart workflow after cache clearing for UI changes to take effect
- This is critical for frontend development workflow

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme and gradient utilities
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Performance**: 3-phase optimization (75% load time reduction), code splitting, lazy loading, memory optimization, critical CSS inlining, service worker caching, chunk preloading.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for server
- **File Uploads**: Multer for multipart form data

## Recent Project Context & Memory

### Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-01)
- **Application Health**: Server fully functional on port 5000, all endpoints operational
- **Pathway Integration**: Successfully added pathway step to onboarding flow before payment with back button navigation
- **Cache Invalidation System**: Comprehensive cache invalidation implemented for V1 routes only
- **Activity Logging System**: V1 upload and folder creation endpoints now log activities for real-time dashboard updates
- **Architecture**: EastEmblem API proxy eliminates need for direct Box SDK integration
- **Payment System**: ✅ **DUAL AUTHENTICATION ARCHITECTURE COMPLETED** - Session-based payment routes (`/api/payment/*`) for onboarding flow, JWT-protected routes (`/api/v1/payment/*`) preserved for future dashboard payments
- **Browser Caching Issue**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Aggressive cache-busting and endpoint renaming forced browser to load fresh JavaScript bundles
- **Authentication Flow**: ✅ **WORKING** - Onboarding payment flow now uses session-based authentication correctly
- **Data Utilization**: 85% of rich scoring API data still unused - opportunity for enhancement
- **Production Security**: Environment-based protection implemented for test endpoints and debug routes

### Unused Secrets Analysis (2025-08-01)
**Safe to Remove (7 total):**
- `LOGO_URL` - Never referenced in codebase
- `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` - Has hardcoded fallback value
- `BOX_PUBLIC_KEY_ID` - Not needed due to EastEmblem proxy
- `BOX_PRIVATE_KEY` - Not needed due to EastEmblem proxy  
- `BOX_ENTERPRISE_ID` - Not needed due to EastEmblem proxy
- `BOX_PASSPHRASE` - Not needed due to EastEmblem proxy
- `BOX_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` - Not needed due to EastEmblem proxy

**Impact Assessment**: Minimal to zero codebase impact from removal

### Architecture Decisions
- **Box Integration**: Using EastEmblem API as Box.com proxy instead of direct Box SDK
- **Payment Gateway**: Generic factory pattern with Telr implementation
- **Monitoring**: Dual system (Sentry + NewRelic) with graceful fallbacks
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with session management
- **File Management**: ProofVault integration through EastEmblem proxy
- **Cache Invalidation**: Event-driven invalidation for V1 routes only (file uploads, folder creation, activity logging, onboarding)

### Development Patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: 3-phase optimization completed (75% load time reduction)
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL, migration via `npm run db:push`
- **Frontend**: React Query for state management, shadcn/ui components
- **Build System**: Vite frontend, esbuild server, no Docker/containers

### Next Priorities
- Score-based payment integration on analysis page
- Utilization of unused scoring API data (venture context, team analysis, traction signals)
- Payment section implementation with Telr hosted page flow
- Enhanced user experience based on ProofScore results

### Security Implementations (Updated: 2025-08-01)
**Environment Protection Strategy**: Complete isolation of development resources from production
**Frontend Security**: Test routes (sentry-test, performance-test, routing-debug, payment-test, reset-password-debug) conditionally rendered using `import.meta.env.MODE === 'development'`
**Backend Security**: Test endpoints (/api/newrelic-test, /api/onboarding/trigger-email-flow) protected with `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` guards
**Security Infrastructure**: Environment protection middleware created for systematic protection of sensitive endpoints
**Production Readiness**: Platform secured against accidental exposure of development tools and system internals in production deployment

### Cache Invalidation Implementation (2025-08-01)
**Scope**: V1 routes only (user preference for targeted implementation)
**Strategy**: Event-driven cache invalidation with graceful error handling

**Cache Invalidation Triggers:**
- **File Upload** (V1 vault upload, direct upload) → Logs activity + Invalidates `vault_{founderId}` + `activity_{founderId}`
- **Folder Creation** (V1 vault create-folder) → Logs activity + Invalidates `vault_{founderId}`  
- **Activity Logging** (ActivityService) → Invalidates `activity_{founderId}`
- **Founder Creation** (V1 onboarding) → Invalidates `founder_{founderId}`
- **Venture Creation** (V1 onboarding) → Invalidates `founder_{founderId}` + `venture_{ventureId}` + `vault_{founderId}`

**Activity Logging Integration:**
- **V1 File Upload** → Creates "file_uploaded" activity with file details
- **V1 Direct Upload** → Creates "file_uploaded" activity with folder information
- **V1 Folder Creation** → Creates "folder_created" activity with category context

**Implementation Details:**
- Graceful error handling (cache failures don't break core functionality)
- LRU + KV cache dual invalidation
- Console logging for cache operations
- Activity-driven cache updates ensure real-time data freshness
