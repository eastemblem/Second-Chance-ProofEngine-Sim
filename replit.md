  * Step 1: Check if current folder is already a main category folder (stop here if yes)
  * Step 2: If subfolder, check if parent is main category folder (stop at category level)
  * Step 3: Only continue recursion if parent is also a subfolder (nested structure)
  * Step 4: Never traverse to root folder 332843137473 which contains all categories
- **ELIMINATED ROOT FOLDER TRAVERSAL**: Prevented categorization logic from reaching root folder that contains all main categories as subfolders
- **FOLDER UPLOAD FAILED FILES DISPLAY FIXED**: Resolved state timing issue where failed files notification appeared but list wasn't shown due to stale state checking
- **SYSTEMATIC UPLOAD TRACKING**: Enhanced handleMultipleFileUpload to track actual upload results during processing instead of checking stale queue state

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Development Communication Pattern**:
- Apply question-first approach to all technical development tasks
- Before implementing any feature or fix, ask relevant counter-questions to gather context
- Only proceed after asking "Do you want me to ask more questions, or should I proceed with the answer?"
- This approach reduces unnecessary work and produces better outputs by understanding requirements fully
- Continue this pattern throughout entire conversation
