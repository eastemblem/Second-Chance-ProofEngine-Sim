## Recent Major Changes (August 2025)

### New Pathway Feature Implementation
**Date**: August 12, 2025

**Summary**: Implemented pathway-based routing that directs users to different experiences based on their ProofScore, removing the payment/next-steps flow from onboarding.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Score Threshold Update**
   - Changed investor readiness threshold from 80 to 70 points
   - Score >= 70: Users see Deal Room page
   - Score < 70: Users see ProofScaling page
   - Files updated: `client/src/pages/pathway.tsx`, `client/src/App.tsx`

6. **Pathway Routing Fix** *(Latest Update)*
   - Fixed "See My Pathway" button to route directly to appropriate pages instead of landing page
   - Added `/deal-room` and `/proofscaling` routes to App.tsx
   - Modified components to fetch session data from localStorage when props unavailable
   - Route `/proofscaling-dashboard` renamed to `/proofscaling` for simplicity
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in ProofScaling component with proper type safety
   - Files updated: `client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/pages/onboarding/analysis.tsx`, `client/src/pages/proofscaling-dashboard.tsx`

7. **Deal Room Sales Page** *(August 12, 2025)*
   - Created comprehensive deal-room-sales page with dark theme, purple and gold colors
   - Replaced original deal-room page with new sales-focused landing page
   - Added sections: Hero, Why Deal Room Works, How It Works, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, CTA
   - Features comparison between traditional vs Deal Room approach
   - Integrated with app's gradient styling and consistent branding
   - Files created: `client/src/pages/deal-room-sales.tsx`
   - Files updated: `client/src/App.tsx` (import and route changes)

2. **Onboarding Flow Simplified**
   - Removed payment step from onboarding flow
   - Users now go directly from analysis to completion
   - Analysis page calls `handleComplete()` instead of continuing to payment
   - Files updated: `client/src/pages/onboarding-flow.tsx`

3. **Analysis Page Cleanup**
   - Removed Download Report, Certificate, and Payment sections from feedback page
   - Created reusable `DownloadSections` component for future use
   - Files updated: `client/src/pages/feedback.tsx`, `client/src/components/download-sections.tsx`

4. **New Email Template**
   - Created verification-only email template without download links
   - Template focuses on email verification and pathway preview
   - Files: `server/templates/emails/onboarding-verification-only.html`
   - Updated email service to use new template: `server/services/emailService.ts`

5. **Backend Changes**
   - Commented out certificate and report generation after scoring
   - Preserved code for future use with TODO comments
   - Files updated: `server/onboarding.ts`

#### Technical Details:

**Frontend Architecture Changes:**
- Simplified onboarding steps array (removed payment step)
- Updated App.tsx routing logic for new score threshold
- Analysis completion now triggers onboarding completion

**Backend Architecture Changes:**
- Email service now sends verification-only emails
- Certificate/report generation temporarily disabled
- Preserved existing API endpoints and functionality

**Component Structure:**
- Created `DownloadSections` component containing:
  - `ReportDownload` component
  - `CertificateDownload` component
  - Simple download cards for future use

## User Flow

### Current Flow (Post-Changes):
1. **Landing** → User starts journey
2. **Onboarding** → Founder details, venture info, team, upload
3. **Processing** → AI analysis and scoring
4. **Analysis** → Results display with "See My Pathway" button
5. **Pathway** → Score-based recommendation (>= 70 = Deal Room, < 70 = ProofScaling)
6. **Completion** → Direct to appropriate experience

### Email Flow:
1. User completes analysis
2. Receives verification-only email with score and pathway preview
3. Email verification leads directly to pathway page

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style Preferences
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow React hooks patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintain component reusability

### Database Changes
- Use Drizzle ORM with `npm run db:push` for schema changes
- Never manually write SQL migrations
- Update `shared/schema.ts` for model changes

### File Editing Rules
- Always view files before editing
- Use exact string matching for replacements
- Preserve indentation and formatting
- Test changes incrementally

## Future Considerations

### Preserved Functionality
- Certificate and report generation code preserved with TODO comments
- Original email template maintained for potential different flows
- Download components available in `download-sections.tsx`

### Potential Enhancements
- Conditional email template selection
- Re-enabling report/certificate generation for premium users
- Enhanced pathway personalization based on detailed scoring

## User Preferences
- Communicate in simple, everyday language
- Avoid technical jargon in user-facing content
- Focus on user journey and experience
- Maintain professional tone without emojis

## Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Frontend domain for email links
- `EASTEMBLEM_API_BASE_URL`: External API base URL
- Various authentication and service keys as needed
