  * Step 3: Only continue recursion if parent is also a subfolder (nested structure)
  * Step 4: Never traverse to root folder 332843137473 which contains all categories
- **ELIMINATED ROOT FOLDER TRAVERSAL**: Prevented categorization logic from reaching root folder that contains all main categories as subfolders
- **FOLDER UPLOAD FAILED FILES DISPLAY FIXED**: Resolved state timing issue where failed files notification appeared but list wasn't shown due to stale state checking

- Before implementing any feature or fix, ask relevant counter-questions to gather context
- Only proceed after asking "Do you want me to ask more questions, or should I proceed with the answer?"
- This approach reduces unnecessary work and produces better outputs by understanding requirements fully
- Continue this pattern throughout entire conversation
