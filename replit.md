- Focus on user journey and experience
- Maintain professional tone without emojis
- Remove technical language from user notifications (e.g., replaced "JWT token invalidated" with user-friendly logout messages)

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a dark theme with purple and gold color schemes, integrating gradient styling and consistent branding. Design principles emphasize interactive elements such as hover effects, animated statistics, and floating background elements to enhance user engagement. Visual components are built for reusability and maintainability, ensuring a cohesive and dynamic user interface.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with TypeScript React and Vite, utilizing React Query for state management and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for styling. The backend is an Express.js serverless application, employing JWT-based authentication and Drizzle ORM for database interactions. Key features include:

#### Clean Unified Encryption Standard (AES-256-GCM) - NODE.JS CRYPTO IMPLEMENTATION
- **Frontend Node.js Crypto:** Replaced Web Crypto API with crypto-browserify for identical encryption between frontend and backend
- **Universal Compatibility:** Both frontend and backend use identical Node.js crypto methods (createCipheriv, createDecipheriv, createHash)
- **Secret Management:** ENCRYPTION_SECRET and VITE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET environment variables verified identical
- **Session Key Format:** Both systems generate identical `public-session-${baseSecret}` format
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Added detailed secret resolution and encryption process logging for debugging
- **Buffer Handling:** Frontend now uses Buffer.from() and toString('base64') identical to backend
- **Key Derivation:** Both systems use crypto.createHash('sha256').update(sessionKey, 'utf8').digest() 
- **AES-GCM Standard:** Both systems use 'aes-256-gcm' with 12-byte IV and 16-byte authentication tag
- **Secure Login Pages:** Multiple interfaces available (`/secure-login`, `/secure-flow-demo`) with Node.js crypto
- **Development Status:** Frontend and backend encryption implementations now functionally identical
- **Score-Based Routing:** Users are directed to different sales pages (`/deal-room` or `/proof-scaling`) based on their ProofScore (threshold at 70 points).
- **Component-Based Design:** Core UI elements are refactored into reusable components (e.g., `AnimatedSection`, `MetricCard`, `GradientButton`) to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment processing for premium features (e.g., Deal Room access) via a modal-based flow with comprehensive activity tracking. Primary integration with PayTabs gateway featuring iframe embedding, multi-region support, and customer data pre-filling. Intelligent currency selection: AED for UAE users and test mode, USD for non-UAE users in live mode (conversion rate: 3.67). Location detection via IP geolocation and CloudFlare headers. Secondary Telr gateway integration with automatic USD to AED currency conversion (rate: 3.673) for UAE market compliance. Both gateways support flexible test/live mode switching via environment variables.
- **Simplified Onboarding:** Streamlined user onboarding by removing intermediate payment steps and directly guiding users to their recommended pathway.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Sophisticated retry logic and detailed error categorization for processes like pitch upload.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Transparent payload encryption for API communications using AES-256-GCM encryption with feature flags (ENABLE_ENCRYPTION/VITE_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION) for controlled rollout. Supports both encrypted and unencrypted requests without breaking existing functionality.
- **Dashboard Architecture:** Restructured dashboard routing system where the new dashboard (DashboardV2) is now the main production dashboard accessible at `/dashboard`. The legacy dashboard remains available at `/dashboard-v1` for development environments only, ensuring backward compatibility during transition periods.

### Feature Specifications
- **Deal Room Access:** Provides qualified users (ProofScore >= 70) access to investor matching and premium features for a one-time fee.
- **ProofScaling Sales Page:** A dedicated experience for startups with ProofScores below 70, offering tailored guidance.
