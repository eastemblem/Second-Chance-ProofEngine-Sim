## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a dark theme with purple and gold color schemes, integrating gradient styling and consistent branding. Design principles emphasize interactive elements such as hover effects, animated statistics, and floating background elements to enhance user engagement. Visual components are built for reusability and maintainability, ensuring a cohesive and dynamic user interface.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with TypeScript React and Vite, utilizing React Query for state management and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for styling. The backend is an Express.js serverless application, employing JWT-based authentication and Drizzle ORM for database interactions. Key features include:
- **Score-Based Routing:** Users are directed to different sales pages (`/deal-room` or `/proof-scaling`) based on their ProofScore (threshold at 70 points).
- **Component-Based Design:** Core UI elements are refactored into reusable components (e.g., `AnimatedSection`, `MetricCard`, `GradientButton`) to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment processing for premium features (e.g., Deal Room access) via a modal-based flow with comprehensive activity tracking. Uses Telr gateway with automatic USD to AED currency conversion (rate: 3.673) for UAE market compliance while displaying USD prices to users. Supports dedicated TELR_TEST_MODE environment variable for flexible test/live mode switching.
- **Simplified Onboarding:** Streamlined user onboarding by removing intermediate payment steps and directly guiding users to their recommended pathway.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Sophisticated retry logic and detailed error categorization for processes like pitch upload.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Transparent payload encryption for API communications using AES-256-GCM encryption with feature flags (ENABLE_ENCRYPTION/VITE_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION) for controlled rollout. Supports both encrypted and unencrypted requests without breaking existing functionality.

### Feature Specifications
- **Deal Room Access:** Provides qualified users (ProofScore >= 70) access to investor matching and premium features for a one-time fee.
- **ProofScaling Sales Page:** A dedicated experience for startups with ProofScores below 70, offering tailored guidance.
- **Direct Pathway Routing:** Eliminates intermediate pages, directly routing users to relevant sales pages post-analysis.
- **Comprehensive Payment Activity Tracking:** Logs all payment-related user interactions for analytics, including initiation, completion, and failure tracking.

### System Design Choices
The system prioritizes a modular, component-driven approach for the frontend and a serverless architecture for the backend to ensure scalability and efficient resource utilization. Drizzle ORM is used for type-safe database interactions, emphasizing schema-driven development. The email service is designed for flexibility, allowing for different email templates based on user flow.
