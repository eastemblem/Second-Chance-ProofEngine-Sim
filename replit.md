## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Development Communication Pattern**:
- Apply question-first approach to all technical development tasks
- Before implementing any feature or fix, ask relevant counter-questions to gather context
- Only proceed after asking "Do you want me to ask more questions, or should I proceed with the answer?"
- This approach reduces unnecessary work and produces better outputs by understanding requirements fully
- Continue this pattern throughout entire conversation
