# Hot Reload Fix Instructions

## Issue
Hot reload was not working because the development script didn't include the `--watch` flag.

## Current Script (package.json)
```json
"dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
```

## Fixed Script (recommended)
```json
"dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx watch server/index.ts"
```

## Manual Hot Reload Solution

Since package.json cannot be edited directly, you can manually start the server with hot reload:

```bash
# Stop current workflow
# Start with hot reload manually:
NODE_ENV=development npx tsx watch server/index.ts
```

## Alternative: Workflow Configuration

Create a custom workflow with the watch flag to enable hot reload.

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Sentry TypeScript errors resolved (removed deprecated Handlers)
2. ✅ Server successfully starts and responds to API calls
3. ⚠️ Hot reload requires manual tsx watch command or package.json update

## Test Hot Reload
1. Start server with: `npx tsx watch server/index.ts`
2. Make any change to server files
3. Server should automatically restart and reflect changes
